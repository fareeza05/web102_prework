## Notes

A few challenges I encountered while building the app were regarding the syntax of the functions or methods that I was unfamiliar with. For example, getting acquainted with deconstruct and spread were quite challenging and I had to learn those concepts in more depth through other sources before correcting my code and implementing it properly. Another challenging concept to me was ternary conditionals, since I am more used to the python syntax, it was quite tough for me to convince myself to temporarily 'unlearn' that method so I could properly adopt the Javascript version of it.
